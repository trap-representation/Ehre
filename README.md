Ehre
----

This is Ehre - a standard-compliant implementation of Chlore.

#### Ehre can currently target: ####
- nightVM (STVM)

#### In the future Ehre will be able to target: ####
- SUBLEQ
- WebAssembly
- CIL
- JVM

Ehre adds some new instructions to Chlore, so you might want to take a look at `ehre_specific_grammar.txt`.

I'm currently working on self-hosting Ehre. I'll put the source here once I'm done writing the lexer.
